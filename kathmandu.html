    <h1>Kathmandu</h1>

        Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, is set in a valley surrounded by the Himalayan mountains.
    At the heart of the old city’s mazelike alleys is Durbar Square, which becomes frenetic
    during Indra Jatra, a religious festival featuring masked dances. Many of the city's historic
    sites were damaged or destroyed by a 2015 earthquake. Durbar Square's palace, Hanuman Dhoka
    , and Kasthamandap, a wooden Hindu temple, are being rebuilt.
